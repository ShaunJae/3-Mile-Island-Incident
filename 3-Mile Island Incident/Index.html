					<h3>
						The Three Mile Island nuclear power generation plant in dauphin county went into a critical state on March 28, 1979. A worker managing the reactor received errors from the reactor core and mistook the errors to mean that there was too much coolant water while the issue was that coolant water was leaking. The worker retracted a large amount of coolant flow which accelerated the problem. The plant almost went into meltdown but emergency precautions were taken and catastrophe was avoided.

					<h2>
						Clean up was done mostly by state responders as the reactors had leaked radioactive contaminated water into the building and it had seeped into the foundation of unit two in the plant. This rendered the unit inoperable for future use. The cleanup took 12 years and cost about one billion dollars while proving to be extremely difficult technically.

					<h2>
						Shortly after leakage a five mile radius evacuation was put in place, farmers were told to bring livestock indoors and to be put on stored feed, and school was canceled. This radius was later extended to 20 miles as the effects of the incident were still unknown. The way this was handled by local authorities was greatly disconcerting to a majority of the American public and even more citizens were displeased with the plant designers.
					</h2>
					</br>
					<h2>
						The NRC took action and many new precautions and educational programs were put into place after the event. Plant design was strengthened and upgraded along with adding more equipment requirements. The critical role of human error was taken factor and operator training and staff requirements were greatly changed to reflect and combat the issues. More monitoring of nuclear plants was also put in place such as inspections, data collection, and licensees.

					<h2>
						Although much of the event was covered at a state and local level, for the immediate cleanup and the beginning of policy creation, many of the laws and regulation made their way to the national government through the independent government agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). A large amount of these laws were made in reflection of what had happened of the local level and were then translated to federal level in hopes to prevent future accidents.

					<h2>
						Much of the steps taken at the state then federal level properly handled the issue although at the dissatisfaction of the public. Between the translation of immediate issues at the state level to the federal government though the NRC and the cleanup process, the way in which the Three Mile Island incident was handled was the best course of action.
